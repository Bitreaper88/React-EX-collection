### H7 Memory game

**Deadline 16.10.2020 10am**

*If you haven't done the first React home assignment yet, focus your energy on that!*

Please save your home assignment as `H7_Firstname_Lastname.zip` and send it to the instructor as a DM in Discord OR if you'd like to, you can create a GitLab repository for your home assignments and send me a link to it.

Remember to include `tsconfig.json` and `package.json` files for easy installation. Especially now that it's a React app!

Create a 4x4 grid that contains 16 memory card components in React. Below you can see an example.

When you click on one of these memory card components, the card gets selected.

![memory-2](/week-7-react/exercises/imgs/memory-2.png)

Clicking on another tile reveals the card contents (text or image). If they are not equal, the tiles flip back after a few seconds. If they are, they will stay turned.

You can also show the card's contents already in the previous step, when the card gets selected.

When all the pairs are found, the game is won.

**Extra:** You can make a counter for how many times the player needed to open tiles to see how well they did in the game.
